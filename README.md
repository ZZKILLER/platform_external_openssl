# OpenSSL for Android #

This is a fork from Android's own OpenSSL library to build OpenVPN for Android.
It still has a lot of the original scripting but has been simplified or only
fixed for the use in OpenVPN for Android.

The Android mk files are very likely not to work anymore. Only the CMAKE files 
are maintained. Check the icsopenvpn repository how to use them.
